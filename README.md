# Simple Linear Regression on Tips Dataset

This project applies Simple Linear Regression to the "tips" dataset from seaborn. Key steps include data exploration, handling missing values, visualizing data, encoding categorical columns, splitting the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The model's effectiveness is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics, with results visualized through scatter plots comparing actual and predicted values.

## Key Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Key Steps

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
2. Data Visualization
